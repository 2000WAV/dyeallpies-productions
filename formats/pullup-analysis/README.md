# Pull-up analysis

A phone clip of one pull-up set, camera on the floor, becomes a rep-counted, biomechanics-
annotated Reel and a full-length analysis, plus a dashboard, a written report with the
papers behind every number and an interactive page. This folder is the third set
(2026-09-08, 11 reps, judged to the USMC standard); the first two sets and everything learned
from them are archived in
[../archive/pullup-analysis-sets-1-2/](../archive/pullup-analysis-sets-1-2/README.md).

- The worked example with the timeline, every pass and every mistake on the way:
  [pullups-2026-09-08.md](pullups-2026-09-08.md)
- The report: [REPORT-3.md](REPORT-3.md) · the caption: [CAPTION-3.md](CAPTION-3.md) ·
  the dashboard: [pullup3-dashboard.png](pullup3-dashboard.png)
- The muscle model, written out with every constant ranked by how well it is known:
  [MUSCLE-MODEL.md](MUSCLE-MODEL.md); its printed validation table: [work3/model_v43.txt](work3/model_v43.txt)
- The plan and the critical assessment of the first two sets: [PLAN-3.md](PLAN-3.md)
- The literature archive (abstracts, open-access full texts, the tables as CSV):
  [references/pullup-science/](../../references/pullup-science/)
- The reel's cut, as a frame schedule: [work3/reel_schedule.json](work3/reel_schedule.json)
- The backdrop and its required credit lines: [assets/ATTRIBUTION.md](assets/ATTRIBUTION.md)

## Outputs

1. `pullup3-analysis.mp4`: the full set at real speed from the moment the hands take the bar
   to 2.3 s after the release, 1080x1920, with the tracked skeleton, the rep counter and phase
   pill, the live elbow angle and speed, the left stack (chin verdicts, speed loss, peak power,
   modelled lat temperature, the two prime movers' fatigued pools, kcal), the muscle map on the
   matted body against the jungle plate, a rep card after every rep, the GitHub box whenever the
   card is off, the shoulder-height chart, and a references card at the end.
2. `pullup3-reel-30.mp4`: the same render cut by frame schedule to 27.7 s (reps 1-2 at real
   speed, 3-10 at x3, rep 11 and the release at real speed).
3. `pullup3-dashboard.png`: the per-rep figure.
4. `pullup3-report.html`: the interactive report built from the analysis JSON.
5. `REPORT-3.md`, `CAPTION-3.md`, `MUSCLE-MODEL.md`.

**Ask for height and body mass up front.** Height calibrates the centimetre scale, mass turns
the kinematics into work, power, force and the joint torques the muscle model starts from.
Ask for a tape measure on the doorway width and the bar height, and for a second phone from
the side: the shoulder's depth behind the bar is computed from a 3D elbow angle, not seen.

## The third set's pipeline (2026-09-08, floor camera)

Scripts with the `3` suffix are the current ones; `work3/` holds the geometry helpers.

## Rules that came out of the third set (2026-09-08, floor camera, anatomy paint) — these supersede

Worked example: `pullups-2026-09-08.md` (in this folder). Scripts:
`analyze_pullups3.py`, `render_pullup_overlay3.py`, `render_pullup_dashboard3.py`,
`build_pullup_page3.py`, `pullup_thermal4.py` (inverse dynamics → force sharing → force–velocity → activation dynamics → fatigue; formulation in `MUSCLE-MODEL.md`; `pullup_thermal3.py` is the phase-table model it replaced), `pullup_atlas3.py`, `pullup_chin_silhouette.py`;
geometry helpers in `pullup/work3/` (`vp_fit.py`, `geom_fit.py`, `rectify.py`, `build_plate3.py`,
`commons_search.py`). Research archive: `references/pullup-science/` (read `01`–`06` before
changing a constant; `DOWNLOADS.md` lists every file).

- **Research before rendering, and archive it.** Every constant in the heat budget, the
  velocity rules and the norms cites a file in `references/pullup-science/`. Agents fetch
  abstracts through PubMed E-utilities and Europe PMC, PDFs with `curl -A "Mozilla/5.0"`;
  the system Python's certificate store is expired, so downloads go through curl.
- **Tone-map HLG before anything reads a pixel.** iPhone clips are 10-bit HLG; the plain
  decode is grey. `libplacebo=tonemapping=bt.2390` on Vulkan (`-init_hw_device vulkan`) into
  an SDR master; zscale hable/mobius are worse by eye.
- **Measure in a rectified plane, render on the frame.** Two vanishing points → f from
  their orthogonality → H = K Rᵀ K⁻¹, then a residual rotation so the fitted bar is exactly
  level (the bar is the judge's line). Verify with the lintel: if it tilts the same way, the
  residual was the model. The plane normal must point away from the camera or the image
  mirrors. Landmarks go through H; the render, the grid (mapped back through H⁻¹) and the
  paint stay in image space.
- **Depth is the allowance, computed.** Elevation to the bar from K and the pitch; a point d
  behind the bar plane projects tan(elevation) × d lower. State the assumed depth (8 cm for
  the chin) and the band it implies (±3 cm) — never a fixed "3 cm".
- **The head hidden at the top is a witness only after you know what hides it.** With a bar
  mounted at the back edge of the lintel's underside, "hidden" means chin ≥ the bar's
  underside sight line, nothing more. Look at a rep top at full resolution with the
  highlights stretched before writing any occlusion bound. YOLO's nose confidence can stay
  high with the head gone; MediaPipe's visibility always does.
- **Chin from the last honest frame.** face_seen = eyes ≥ 4 cm under the bar's underside
  AND nose confidence > 0.35; chin at the top = face-axis chin there + the shoulder rise
  since. Print in-plane, adjusted and the head-hidden time per rep.
- **Phases from the local base.** The passive dead hang sits 2–3 cm below the active hang;
  the concentric starts from the highest shoulder position in the second before the pull.
- **Reference windows:** stature = the reach under the bar (arms up, at the bar plane);
  shoulder-tilt reference = arms down, after the set; ear-to-shoulder reference = the dead
  hang, never the reach (it reads a 10 cm "shrug" on every top).
- **Scale check by physics:** shoulder-to-bar at the dead hang must equal 0.332 × stature
  within a few percent. The wrist-based arm anchor under-reads by ~13 % (the wrist is 8 cm
  below the bar); report it, do not average it in.
- **Velocity: rep 1 is the reference (Beckham 2018), the fastest rep beside it; loss against
  25 % / 50 % (Sánchez-Moreno 2020); RIR is a range, never an integer.**
- **The chest flush is not muscle heat at the skin.** Skin blood flow falls in the first
  minute of exercise; report the index as effort-tracking and say what it is not.
- **Anatomy paint:** regions with fibre-direction fields (fan to the tendon or parallel),
  grooves with an inner highlight, belly shading, irregular thin striations, the frame's own
  luminance kept deep; ironbow scale 0 → +1.5 °C; names shown once when a muscle passes
  +0.3 °C. Preview hang / mid-pull / top at 1:1 before rendering.
- **Layout for a centred, large body:** push in only as far as keeps the bar under the
  Instagram top band; no side panels over the arms — readouts are pills beside the elbow
  and hips; the legend lives in the chart header; the card leads with three numbers.
- **Backdrop:** Commons API with `iiurlwidth` for thumbnails (hand-built thumb URLs 400),
  originals into `pullup/assets/commons/` with `CREDITS.json`; rembg isnet + alpha matting
  for cut-outs, drop any that sat on branches; the cat is pasted from its own mask.
- **Tooling hygiene:** patch scripts from a file with `encoding="utf-8"` (a heredoc here
  mangles `\n` and non-ASCII); run long renders with `python -u` straight to a log.
- Next upgrades, licence-checked in `05-ml-tooling-survey.md`: DWPose via rtmlib (jawline
  keypoints), SAM 2 for person + cat masks, SCHP for body-part parsing.

## Efficiency score (per rep, /100)

ROM 25 (chin at or over the bar, −2.5 per cm short) · eccentric control 20 (full at
1.5 s) · lock-out 15 (155°+ full, 0 at 120°) · low sway 15 (≤ 4 cm hip sway full, 0 at
20 cm) · pull speed 15 (peak concentric velocity ÷ the best rep of the set) · L/R
symmetry 10 (≤ 5° mean elbow gap full, 0 at 25°). A ≥ 85, B ≥ 70, C ≥ 55. The letter is
a footnote; the rep card and the chart chips carry the chin verdict.

## Next time

- Film from further back or higher so the head never leaves the frame at the top; then
  the chin can be measured directly instead of inferred.
- A side-on second angle makes sway, kip and lat work far more trustworthy.
- Skip the long dead hang if the set is a max-rep test.

## Caption

At most 2000 characters, one paragraph per line, five hashtags. Hook on the count and the
verdict, one paragraph on what the model is and one on what it is not, the four verdict
lines, the repository link, a question, the backdrop credits. See [CAPTION-3.md](CAPTION-3.md).
